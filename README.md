# SWAPI and deckofcards API

## Project Overview

This project is the part of Lexicon education based on React and integrates two APIs:

1. **Star Wars API (SWAPI)** – Users can enter a character's name and retrieve biometric data (e.g., height, mass, gender, hair color) for the selected Star Wars character.
2. **Deck of Cards API** – Users can draw a card from a deck, displaying the card's value, suit, and an image of the card.

The project is built using **React**, utilizes **Vite** as the build tool, and is styled with **Tailwind CSS**. It includes functionalities like fetching data from the APIs, handling user input, and rendering the results.
